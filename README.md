# RockPaperScissorsGraphicBySvetozarP
A graphic version of the popular "Rock Paper Scissors"

The project contains a graphic version of the famous "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, written in Python.

The goal of the project was to convert the console game written earlier to a graphic version.

The game itself employs conditional statements, TKinter library and while loops. Player selects a button, corresponding to the choises from the famous game. Through the Random library in Python, computer move is generated and compared to the player's choice. Scores are accumulated throughout the game.

Please see below a screenshot from the game itself:
